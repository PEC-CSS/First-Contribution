In the realm of code and screens,
Where the keystrokes dance and gleam,
There lies a graveyard, somber and still,
A place where code goes to be killed.

This graveyard was born of inaction,
A monument to apathy's satisfaction,
For the IB neglected to heed the call,
Leaving ACM CSS to stumble and fall.

But though the IB may have let us down,
The graveyard stands as a solemn crown,
A testament to all that was lost,
And a reminder of the line we crossed.

For in the world of bits and bytes,
Our actions have eternal sights,
And though the graveyard may be still,
Its presence is a warning, a bitter pill.

So let us not forget this place,
And the cost of our lack of grace,
For in the end, we must all be aware,
That inaction has a price we cannot bear.
